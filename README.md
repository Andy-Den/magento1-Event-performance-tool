# Magium Load Testing Magento 1 Performance Tool

This is a tool used to capture Magento 1 requests and store the timings using the Magento 1 event system.  It is stored in var/magium_performance_tool.

It is intended for use with the [10n Magium Load Testing](http://www.magiumlib.com/load-test) service, but anyone can use this code if they want to capture information on a request-by-request basis.
